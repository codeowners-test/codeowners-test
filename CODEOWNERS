# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies files in the `/service-a` directory in the root of your
# repository and any of its subdirectories, only @stefandriy
# and not the globalowner(s) will be requested for a review.
